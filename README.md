# Customer Segmentation
## To predict the outcome of the campaign 

1) Develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow which only comprises of
Dense, Dropout, and Batch Normalization layers.
2) The accuracy of the model must be more than 70%. 
3) Display the training loss and accuracy on TensorBoard
4) Create modules (classes) for repeated functions to ease your training and 
testing process

### EDA 
1) Data Loading
2) Data Inspection
3) Data Cleaning
4) Features Selection
5) Preprocessing
6) Model development
7) Model Evaluation
